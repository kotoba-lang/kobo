;; The PORTABLE suite on nbb, separate from `run_host_tests.cljs`.
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:$(clojure -Spath -M:test)" test/run_portable.cljs
;;
;; Two runners, and the split is the repository's own: `run_host_tests.cljs`
;; covers `kobo.host.*`, which is ClojureScript on Node by design and cannot
;; load on the JVM. Its header says `clojure -M:test` covers the portable
;; model and the console — and that was true and also the whole gap. The JVM
;; is one runtime. `kobo.ui` and `kobo.workbench` are `.cljc`, which is a claim
;; that they run on two, and nothing was checking the second one.
;;
;; Both suites run green here as they stand: this adds coverage, it does not
;; fix anything. What it stops is the next portable defect being invisible
;; (root ADR-2608730000: a `.cljc` file whose tests only ever ran on the JVM).
;;
;; Every `.cljc` test namespace that is not host-specific must be named BOTH in
;; the require and in `run-tests` — being required is not being run. The
;; superproject's `scripts/verify-cljs-runner-completeness.cljs` measures this
;; file against the directory.
